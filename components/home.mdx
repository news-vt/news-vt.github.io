The **N**etwork sci**E**nce, **W**ireless, and **S**ecurity laboratory at Virginia Tech (**NEWS@VT**)  is a research group focused on developing fundamental mathematical tools and principles to design, develop, and build smart, secure, and self-organizing systems, with applications to networks, wireless systems, Internet of things (IoT) systems, smart power grids, and cyber-physical systems. Our research is largely interdisciplinary and draws upon tools from optimization, game theory, machine learning, statistics, control and economics to design and build networks and cyber-physical systems.

- We are currently focused on several research thrusts:
- Metaverse, digital twins, and extended reality over wireless networks
- Semantic communications and networking.
- Wireless 6G networks.
- **Machine learning, distributed (federated) learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) for wireless networks.**
- Quantum machine learning and quantum communication networks.
- Drones and connected autonomy (control, communications, sensing).
- Game theory.
- Cyber-physical systems.
- Cybersecurity.
